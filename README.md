## Running the Experiments ##

**Note:** The experiments will take some time and use up to 10 cores. If
you want to change the number of cores, edit the line
`run.use_cores(10)` in the file `experiments.py` accordingly.

### Easy Mode ###

If you are on a Linux environment and satisfies all [dependencies](#dependencies), the
experiments can be run using just one command.

```console
python experiments.py pre experiments post
```

This will compile the c++ code, run the experiments, and create the
plots.  The resulting plots and the data they are based on can be
found in `eval/tex/master.pdf` and `eval/data/`, respectively.

### Manual Mode ###

On non-Linux systems, you might run into some problems with the above
command.  Instead use the following three steps to compile the code,
run the experiments, and create the plots.

#### Compiling ####

Use cmake to compile the code in `code/`.  Make sure to use
`code/release/` as build directory so that the experiment script can
find it.  When using make (e.g., on Linux), this can be done like
this:

```console
mkdir code/release
cd code/release
cmake ..
make
```

If you are using Windows with Visual Studio, you can do something like
this instead:

```console
cd code
cmake .
cmake --build . --config Release
```

This will create the command line application for running the flip
Schelling process on different types of random networks.  If you want
to use this directly (instead of running our set of experiments), call
`run --help` for more information and see `experiments.py` for example
calls.

#### Running the Experiments ####

To actually run the experiments, call 

```console
python experiments.py experiments
```

This will take some time.  The resulting data is stored
in csv-files in `eval/data/`.

To run only a subset of experiments, specify the experiments you want
to run when calling `experiments.py`, e.g., call `python
experiments.py intro visualization` to run the experiments for the
intro and the visualization.

#### Create the Plots ####

First, run the R-scripts in the `eval/` folder (`crit-avg-deg.R`,
`extended.R`, `intro-plot.R`, `visualization.R`).  This creates
pdf-plots in `eval/pdf/` as well as TikZ-plots in `eval/tex/`.  To
compile the TikZ plots, run LaTeX for the file `eval/tex/master.tex`.

## Dependencies ##

  * **cmake, c++:** To compile the c++ code, you need cmake and a
    somewhat recent c++ compiler.
  * **run (python):** For running the experiments, you need python
    with the module [`run`](https://github.com/thobl/run).  Install
    `run` (and its dependencies) as described
    [here](https://github.com/thobl/run#installation) (basically:
    download the repository and call `pip install .`).
  * **R:** For plotting, you need R with the libraries `ggplot2`,
    `egg`, and `tikzDevice`.
  * **LaTeX:** You need LaTeX if you want to compile the TikZ-output
    created by R.
  * **Ipe:** The example visualization is created using Ipe.  If you
    have Ipe installed and your system finds the executable
    `ipetoipe`, then the visualization will be rendered to pdf.
    Otherwise, the Ipe file is created but it is not rendered to pdf
    (and you will see a warning).
